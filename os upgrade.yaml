1. We need to take "node01" out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
# kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

2.The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node node01 to be schedulable again.
 # kubectl uncordon node01

3.hr-app is a critical app and we do not want it to be removed and we do not want to schedule any more pods on node01.
Mark node01 as unschedulable so that no new pods are scheduled on this node.
Make sure that hr-app is not affected.
# kubectl cordon node01 (This will ensure that no new pods are scheduled on this node)
Do not drain node01, instead use the kubectl cordon node01 command. 
This will ensure that no new pods are scheduled on this node and the existing 
pods will not be affected by this operation.
